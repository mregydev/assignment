- Create a JS function that takes one argument N and returns an array with N numbers.

- In a condition that sum of N numbers is equal 0 and numbers are unique so array doesn't contain any repeated number, the array could contain positive or 0 or negative numbers
  For example, if we call solution(4), it should return an array with 4 numbers, this array could be [-3,0,1,2] or [3,5,-8,0] but it can't be [1,1,-2,0] as 1 repeated.

- Another example, if we call solution(3), it should return an array with 3 numbers, this array could be [-3,0,3]
